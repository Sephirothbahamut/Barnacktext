 <p> Donald has a few memorable phrases that he occasionally comes out with in certain situations. For example, when he stumbles across other characters in the midst of planning some sort of retaliation or prank, or when things do not go as he had planned or do not work properly, he often says, "What's the big idea!?" When he gives up on something he is trying to do, or something he hopes will happen, he tends to say, "Aw, phooey!" When he confronts someone/something that is antagonizing or frustrating him, he tends to exclaim, "So!!" He greets his girlfriend Daisy, and occasionally others, with, "Hiya, toots!" And when he is very excited about something, he usually mutters, "Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy..." under his breath. </p>
