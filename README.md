# Barnacktext

Project compirsed of 2 parts:
1) A compiler from a custom markdown-like language with latex inspired syntax into partial HTML pages.
The compiler runs on a root directory and compiles all the .bartex files into HTML in a mirrored directory structure.
(Complete for the few current features)

2) An HTML home page with scripts to manage navigation in the directory structure between the partial HTML pages which are included in-place
(Incomplete)
